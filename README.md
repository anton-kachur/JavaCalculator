# JavaCalculator

A calculator capable of performing general arithmetic operations on expressions (+, -, /, *). 

Among basic operations also are: % - remainder division op., ^ - pow op. 
Also, the functional consists of a numerator of integrals and areas of some figures (square, rectangle, triangle, circle).


## How to use it
1. Download .zip file with Java code and open it in IntellijIdea or some other IDE.
2. Run application.

### If you use non-GUI version of calculator
You can either enter arithmetic expression in console e.g. (12+3 x 3)-(2^3^4)
or write "integral", "area {figure name}" or "matrix". 
Then you need to write all necessary parameters for them.

### If you use GUI version of calculator
In opened window write expression, "integral", "area" or "matrix".
In the latter cases, windows open where you will need to enter 
the necessary parameters for calculating integrals, areas or matrix.
